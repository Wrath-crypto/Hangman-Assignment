// Main game loop
Start Game:
  Display Title Screen (with hangman image – hmm, how to center that properly?)
  Get player name (maybe?)
  Select Language (needs a menu!)
  While game not over:
    Display game UI (hangman, guessed letters, word)
    Get player guess (letter or word)
    IF guess is correct:
      Display win message
      Calculate game stats
      Show post-game menu
    ELSE IF guess is incorrect:
      Update hangman image (is there a bug here?  The last image doesn’t show!)
      Add guess to wrong guesses
      IF all guesses used:
        Display lose message
        Calculate game stats
        Show post-game menu
  End While

Show Post-Game Menu:
  Display options: Play Again, Main Menu, Exit
  Get player choice
  IF Play Again:  startGame()  // Should this be startGame()? Or something else?
  IF Main Menu: Go to Main Menu
  IF Exit: Exit game


Select Language:
  Display language list
  Get user choice (input validation needed!)
  Set selectedLanguage


Display Game UI:
  Clear screen
  Print guessed word
  Print hangman image (check if the hangman index is correct... it is, right?)
  Print wrong guesses

Calculate Game Stats:
  endTime = current time
  timeTaken = endTime - startTime  // Should I divide by 1000?
  print "Wrong guesses:", wrongGuesses.size
  print "Time taken:", timeTaken


//Functions that need to be implemented or fixed
//This function is wrong, and needs to be fixed
isWordGuessed(word, guess):
  return word == guess //This is wrong for partial matches
